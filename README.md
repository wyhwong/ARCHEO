# ARCHEO
ARCHEO is a repository for inferring the natal kick and parental masses posterior of black holes in Pair-instability Supernova (PISN) gap. We study the parental black holes of GW190521 and investigate the probability that the component black holes in GW190521 are a result of black hole merger. The methodology is described in [Methodology](#methodology) section, and it can be applied to any other gravitational wave event.

# Application - GW190521

We can use the scripts in the repository to estimate the parental mass and kick of component black holes in GW190521. Please find the related data of GW190521 in [LIGO Document P2000158-v4](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2000158/public).
